ðŸŸ¢ BEGINNER LEVEL: FOUNDATION
ðŸ”¹ What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that structures software around objects â€” real-world-like entities that contain data and behavior.

ðŸ”¹ Key Terminology
Class: A blueprint for creating objects (like a design plan).

Object: An instance of a class (a real usable version).

Method: A behavior (function) that an object can perform.

Attribute: A property or data point of an object.

ðŸ”¹ Core OOP Concepts (The "Big Four")
Encapsulation

Hides internal object details.

Groups data and behavior logically.

Protects object integrity by exposing only what's necessary.

Abstraction

Shows only essential features.

Hides complex implementation from the user.

Simplifies interaction with objects.

Inheritance

One class can derive features from another.

Promotes code reuse.

Enables hierarchical relationships.

Polymorphism

One interface, multiple implementations.

Allows different objects to respond to the same message in different ways.

ðŸŸ¡ INTERMEDIATE LEVEL: DESIGN UNDERSTANDING
ðŸ”¹ Access Control
Public: Accessible everywhere.

Protected: Accessible within the class and subclasses.

Private: Accessible only within the class.

This supports data hiding, which is part of encapsulation.

ðŸ”¹ Relationships
Inheritance (IS-A): A subclass is a specialized form of a superclass.

Composition (HAS-A): An object is made of other objects.

Prefer composition over inheritance for flexibility and reduced coupling.

ðŸ”¹ Responsibilities of a Class
A class should have one clear purpose (Single Responsibility).

Classes should be modular, focusing on clarity and reusability.

ðŸ”¹ OOP vs Procedural
OOP: Emphasizes objects and data.

Procedural: Emphasizes functions and procedures.

OOP is often better for complex systems requiring modularity and scalability.

ðŸ”´ SENIOR LEVEL: DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND ARCHITECTURE
ðŸ”¹ SOLID Principles (OOP Best Practices)
Single Responsibility Principle

Each class should have one purpose.

Open/Closed Principle

Classes should be open to extension but closed to modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle

Subclasses should be usable in place of their base classes without breaking functionality.

Interface Segregation Principle

Don't force classes to depend on interfaces they don't use.

Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Design Patterns
Patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems.

Creational Patterns: Deal with object creation (e.g., Singleton, Factory).

Structural Patterns: Deal with object composition (e.g., Adapter, Decorator).

Behavioral Patterns: Deal with object communication (e.g., Strategy, Observer).

Patterns are NOT rules â€” they are tools to improve design when used appropriately.

ðŸ”¹ Common Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)
God Object: A class that does everything.

Tight Coupling: Classes that depend too heavily on each other.

Poor Abstraction: Exposing too many details or having unclear responsibilities.

ðŸ”¹ OOP and Maintainability
OOP isnâ€™t just about modeling things â€” itâ€™s about writing flexible, maintainable, testable, and scalable code. It enables large teams to work on complex systems with minimal friction.
